# Sliding Puzzle Solver
This is a fun little project I had in mind and finally decided to code up a website for. 

Play it here: https://creeperman1524.github.io/SlidingPuzzleSolver/ ðŸš€

It currently features a 3x3 board of 8 tiles, where you can randomly scramble them to try to put them back to their original position.
The solve button uses the A* algorithm to find the shortest solution using the current state of the puzzle. You can also click on the tiles to try to solve it yourself!

## Credits
- [This project](https://codepen.io/camchambers/pen/rNzdJzG) for providing a boilerplate solution to the website, which I fitted to my needs.
- [This course assignment](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring19/cos226/assignments/8puzzle/specification.php) for providing information on how to create a solver like this
